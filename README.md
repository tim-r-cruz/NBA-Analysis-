# NBA-Analysis 


### Summary 
This notebook outlines my very naive analysis of the NBA. Using basic player statistics, I attempt to answer the following questions: 
  1) What teams have small budgets compared to the rest of the NBA?
  2) If we want to maximize offensive capability, what positions should be prioritized?
  3) What is the best way to assign a player to a position?
  4) Is there a way to determine a 'fair' salary for a player in the NBA?
  5) What suggests that a player is undervalued?
